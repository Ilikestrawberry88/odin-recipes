    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles (uncooked)</li>
      <li>4 cups mozzarella cheese (shredded and divided)</li>
      <li>½ cup parmesan cheese (shredded and divided)</li>
      <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ pound Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 onion (diced)</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
      <li>36 ounces pasta sauce (*see note)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>2 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh parsley (chopped)</li>
      <li>1 egg (beaten)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol type="I">
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. In a large pot of salted water, boil lasagna noodles until al dente according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
      <li>Brown the beef and sausage. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
      <li>Make the pasta sauce. Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until thickened.</li>
      <li>Make the ricotta cheese mixture. In a separate bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>Assemble the lasagna. Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9x13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
      <li>Cover and bake. Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Top with cheese and bake again. Remove the foil and sprinkle with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
      <li>Let it rest. Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.
      </li>
